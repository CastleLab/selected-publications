# Selected Publications

This repository collects the publications in CASTLE Research Group. 

CASTLE members can push their new publications in this repository. 
The publication website of CASTLE homepage will fetch data in this repository and display the publications [here](http://sccpu2.cse.ust.hk/castle/publication/).

## âœ¨ New Features

- Now we support hosting paper's author version or slides in this repository. Just put your preprints or slides in the [assets](.assets) folder and refer to them in the publication declaration file with `{ASSETS}` as url prefix. For example, `"paperUrl": "{ASSETS}/DArcher-FSE21.pdf`, which will be resolved as `https://castlelab.github.io/selected-publications/assets/DArcher-FSE21.pdf`.


## Add Your Publication

### Clone or Pull the Project

Clone the project if you don't have it previously:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CastleLab/selected-publications.git && cd selected-publications
```

Pull the latest commit in the root directory if you already have it.
```bash
git pull
```

### Add Publication Declaration File

We use a declaration file in `js`format to declare the publications.
To add publications:
1. Copy and rename a template ([js template](./publications.template.js)), e.g., firstName_lastName.js, then put it into `collection` folder (or any sub-folders in it).
2. Modify the template file and declare your publications. You can find explanations of data fields in the template files.
3. (Optional) Test your declaration file, as explained in section blow: Test Your Publication Declaration File.
3. Commit your changes in git and push to this repository. CASTLE members in the [CastleLab](https://github.com/CastleLab) GitHub organization should have the privilege to push to this repository. If you don't, please contact Wuqi Aaron Zhang (wuqi.zhang@connect.ust.hk).
   
Note that you can declare multiple publications in one file since the template file declares an array in it.

We prefer `js` declaration file because the limitations of `json` syntax is annoying, e.g., cannot add comments, special characters need to be escaped, no multiline strings, etc. 
It is inconvenient to add abstract and bibtex in `json` files since they are usually multiline strings and may contain special characters. 
Nevertheless, you can still use [json template](./publications.template.json) if you like. 


## Test Your Publication Declaration File (Optional)

You may need to test whether the your declaration file is valid or not. 
Invalid declarations will be ignored and there will be no warnings. 

Therefore, we provide a script to help you test. 

The script is written in JavaScript, so you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) environment installed on your computer. 

After the Node.js environment is set up, execute the following commands in the terminal under the root directory of this repository.
```bash
npm install
npm test
```

If no errors are printed in the console, you are good to push it on GitHub. 
Your publications will automatically added on CASTLE HomePage. 

## About Display Order

The default order in the [Publication](http://sccpu2.cse.ust.hk/castle/publication/) page is `date descending` (the latest publication is shown on the top).
The date of each publication is defined by the [`date` field](./publications.template.js#L4) in declaration file. 
The value of `date` field is a [ECMA date string](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/#sec-date-time-string-format), e.g., `2021` and `2021-12-31`. 
If only year is provided, it will be considered as `year-01-01`. 
Please try to give precise publication date. 
It is discouraged to only provider year in the date string. 

The [Publication](http://sccpu2.cse.ust.hk/castle/publication/) page has its own sort control panel, which can sort publications by title, author, date, or search similarity with or without reverse order.
