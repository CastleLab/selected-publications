    Recently, programming by examples (PBE) technique achieves a great success in processing and transforming data entities, yet existing approaches generally fall short on the tasks concerning entity relations. This paper presents ENTER, a domain-agnostic language for relation-aware entity transformation synthesis. It leverages the combination of two basic relations, the equivalence relation and the total order relation, to succinctly express complex entity relations. ENTER can be instantiated with domain-specific elements to solve a wide range of entity transformation tasks.
