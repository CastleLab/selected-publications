    Many smartphone applications' smart services are realized in a way that wastes energy or degrades performance, seriously affecting the user experience. What's worse, developers lack powerful tools to combat such problems, curbing the growth of Internet-based mobile computing. Research communities and industries have issued a strong call for effective techniques to diagnose energy and performance bugs in smartphone applications. This article describes bug characteristics, discusses diagnostic challenges, and reviews state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques. A case study shows how a representative tool analyzed commercial Android applications and the Samsung Mobile Software Developer's Kit, providing useful diagnostic information.
